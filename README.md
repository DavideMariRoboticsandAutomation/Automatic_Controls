I am pleased to present two significant projects that I completed during my studies in Computer Engineering at the University of Tor Vergata. These projects involved the extensive use of MATLAB and Simulink, powerful tools for numerical computation and model-based design, respectively.
The first project focuses on developing an automatic control system to manage the pitch of an airplane. Pitch refers to the upward or downward pitching motion of the aircraft about its longitudinal axis. In other words, the goal is to implement a feedback system that adjusts the aircraft's pitch in a controlled and precise manner. MATLAB and Simulink were instrumental in designing and simulating this control system, allowing for thorough analysis and optimization of the systemâ€™s performance.
The second project is centered around the development of an automatic speed control system. The purpose of this system is to maintain the vehicle at a constant speed despite external disturbances. Using MATLAB and Simulink, I was able to model the dynamics of the vehicle, design the control algorithm, and simulate various scenarios to ensure the system's robustness and reliability.
Both projects were integral in enhancing my understanding of theoretical concepts and their practical applications. The use of MATLAB and Simulink not only improved my technical skills but also prepared me for future challenges in the field of engineering.
Attached, you will find the complete reports for these projects, as well as the corresponding MATLAB and Simulink codes.
Thank you for your attention.
